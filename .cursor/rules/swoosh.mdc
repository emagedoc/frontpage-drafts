## Idea

In this design, we want to emphasize key points in the project kind of like cards that swipe the left or right (after a brief delay or when clicking).

## Content

You want to have a main title and a subtitle driving home, maybe as a quesiton the main idea of the project.

Then there should be a link "jump to leaderboard" that scrolls to the leaderboard section.

Then there should be one more cards at the same time with some key points.

## Styling

The target audience is programmers, researchers, software people so think of a design with clear fonts, maybe some fixed width font to emphasize the software/technical nature of the project.
Don't do too much whimsical and make sure it doesn't look like a web shopping website or one of the anonymous business websites. Instead focus on clean minimal design, maybe like some hipster software company website.
