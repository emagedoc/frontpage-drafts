## Idea

In this design, we want to emphasize storytelling.
There are first a few short paragraphs that tell the story of the project.
Then, there is the leaderboard table.

## Content

Here is a possible example of such a story:

We all know that LMs make pretty good junior developers. Give them a small bug or ask them to implement something specific, they’ll get it done most of the time.
But the real world has no GitHub issues, only goals

Complete the story based on the abstract.

## Styling

The story should be in short sentences at the top of the page, but even before that there should be a link "jump to leaderboard".

The target audience is programmers, hackers, researchers, so think of a design with strong whites and blacks, clear fonts, maybe some fixed width font to emphasize the software/technical nature of the project.
